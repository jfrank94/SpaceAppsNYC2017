The overview of this project was to connect climate change to theâ€©quality of life of New Yorkers. We wanted to hone in on low income neighborhoods, because they are usually at risk for vulnerabilities of ecological factors. We saw that the Urban Heat Island Effect which
greatly impacts NYC as a whole as a special negative impact on low
income neighborhoods. We offered the solution urban farming to not only
help curb this phenomena and also help economically empower low income
neighborhoods as well. We then expanded on the other aspects that are
negatively affecting low income neighborhoods, such as, food
accessibility to prove out point why urban farming can help all urban
communities can help them in particular with economic development.
